# EeveeBox archive
Do you remember that janky website I made long time ago? EeveeBox, yeah, it's now open-source (MIT License). Do anything you want with my janky code.

**Do NOT use it for a website that will be entirely public**. As I said the code is super janky and it's not actually really stable if it's for a big website.

## What is EeveeBox ?
EeveeBox, is a chatting website, based on PHP and HTML/CSS/JS, the goal is simple, being a good way of communicating with random people on the web. (and it failed because lack of friends)
It supports very basic markdown, emojis, has *some* fixed flaws, and things, you know.
The problem of it, is that, the method of chatting is, basically awful.

## Why is it *so* janky?
Overall, you join a channel, all is fine, good, and yeah. HOWEVER, once you see the chat, it will ping the log of the chat EVERY SECOND.
Imagine 10 persons in the chat. That means, 10 persons that pings the website to request data (and it grows with the message), **EVERY SECOND**.

There is also no way to see how much people are online. Nor to see if they leaved.
There is just a janky 'Leave Chat' button. People better be closing tabs than pressing a button with a confirmation THEN closing the tab.

There is also a poor protection for spamming. It slows down people that spams, sorta, but it doesn't kick them, or anything else.
There is also no restrictions in term of logging, someone can have 20 tabs of EeveeBox and have an account on each of the tabs.

It was, janky. Do not use it.

## Why did you uploaded it then ? 
So that's not me who maintains the website anymore. I didn't even checked it since a whole year.
You can also learn from my old sins I did.
Or fork it and make it better and less janky.
You decide.

*Oh, and, I'm working on something less janky of course. No worries. But it WON'T be called EeveeBox, lmfao.*

Also Eevee is from uhh trademark Nintendo whatever is it.
Eevee is good but the community is shit, same for Nintendo itself.
I understand why people want to go back.

No Nintendo, I don't have any childs named 'Luigi'. Chill down.
